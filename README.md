# Face-recognition-using-pre-trained-inception-model-transfer-learning-
In this project, we will be using a pre-trained model which represents ConvNet activations using a "channels first" convention, as opposed to the "channels last" convention. In other words, a batch of images will be of shape  (𝑚,𝑛𝐶,𝑛𝐻,𝑛𝑊)  instead of  (𝑚,𝑛𝐻,𝑛𝑊,𝑛𝐶) . Face recognition is a computer vision task of identifying and verifying a person based on a photograph of their face. We will mainly use transfer learning method to load a pre-trained model. The pre-trained model used here is a model inspired by the FACENET algorithm by google.
